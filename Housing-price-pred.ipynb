    "Project Description\n",
    "The House Price Prediction System is a comprehensive machine learning project designed to predict the sale prices of residential properties based on various features. This project aims to leverage historical data to build a predictive model that can assist buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals in making informed decisions regarding property transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objectives\n",
    "Data Analysis: To explore and analyze the dataset, identifying key features that influence house prices.\n",
    "Data Preprocessing: To clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.\n",
    "Model Development: To implement and compare various machine learning algorithms, including linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting methods.\n",
    "Model Evaluation: To evaluate the performance of different models using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared values.\n",
    "Model Optimization: To fine-tune the selected model using techniques like cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning for improved accuracy.\n",
    "Data Sources\n",
    "The dataset used for this project is derived from the House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques competition on Kaggle."
